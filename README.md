# QGIS Briefing
Thanks for joining QGIS Briefing on 12 Aug 2022. Want to give it a try? Here are the relevant resources such as tutorial videos, code snippets and plugins of QGIS and use cases.

## General Usage of QGIS
For the general usage of QGIS, visit [QGIS Tutorials and Tips](https://www.qgistutorials.com/en/index.html)!

## Use Case #1 - File Format Conversion
Convert file format with few clicks! You may refer to the tutorial videos, e.g. [Convert DWG Files of AutoCAD into Shapefile in QGIS](https://youtu.be/qloaSsrNeAQ).

## Use Case #2 - Use of Graphical Modeler
Streamline your workflow with zero code. If you wish to have more understandings on QGIS Graphical Modeler, you may take a look on [QGIS Part 2 - Graphical Modeler](https://youtu.be/fjxJwMSp0K4). The QGIS model file shown to you during the briefing is also available in use-case-2 folder.

If you are interested in converting CSV into point using QGIS, just watch [Converting CSV to a shapefile in QGIS](https://youtu.be/drIpvJm7OMs)!

## Use Case #3 - Data Processing Automation
Automate your task using > 50 lines of code. The source codes presented to you can be found in use-case-3 folder. Visit [QGIS using Python Programming for Beginners](https://youtu.be/dpJqmLIaELk) to know more about QGIS and Python.

## Use Case #4 - Plan Production
If you want to make your first map/plan in QGIS, please have a look at this [procedure](https://www.qgistutorials.com/en/docs/making_a_map.html).

## Use Case #5 - Data Collection using QField
QGIS provides an open-source data collection tool, named QField. There is a demonstration [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qE22Iz6ymA) for you to learn how to set-up a project, collect the data, and sync with GIS platform.

## Use Case #6 - Image Classification using Semi-automatic Change Detection Plugin
This plugin provides a set of intertwined tools and a user interface for easing and automating the phases of land cover classification, from the download of remote sensing images to post-processing for assessing the classification accuracy. If you are interested, feel free to surf this [page](https://fromgistors.blogspot.com/p/semi-automatic-classification-plugin.html).

## Use Case #7 - Analysis using Google Earth Engine
If you look forward to learning raster data analysis. QGIS provides a way to integrate with one of the most powerful tools in the world, the Google Earth Engine through QGIS Python Console. You can start with this [tutorial](https://github.com/giswqs/qgis-earthengine-examples/).
